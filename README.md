This is an adoption and packaging of other contribution to Alfresco: share-extra:media preview, freemind-indexing, freemind-preview

Repo (0.52) jar installs in tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib Share jar installs in tomcat/shared/lib

Indexing is supported through transform to plain text

Preview need two files (flashobject.js, visorFreemind.swf or visorFreeplane.swf) added to tomcat/webapps/share/freemind/components/preview/

Get files from freemind or freeplane by exporting to flash, I used freeplane since it looked as it is more updated.
